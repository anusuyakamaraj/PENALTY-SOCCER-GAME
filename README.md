# PENALTY-SOCCER-GAME
The title of our game is penalty soccer game . This project is about a penalty game in football . This project was developed by using python pygame . There are two players in the game . We are focusing developing a 2D Penalty Soccer Game . Each player will have a 5 penalty shoots. In this game Goal Keeper will save the ball or allow the ball . If Goal Keeper allow the ball the point will increase by 1 for each player . If Goal Keeper save the ball the point will not increase and decrease for each player.In order to improve the match success rate, we proposed a penalty kick strategy based on two-player shooting method which is used in two different defense patterns. In this strategy, a shooting method is applied when the opponent goalkeeper run out to destroy the ball and a reflecting shooting method is used when the goalkeeper stays at the goal line.
